# Deployment Rational

## Problem of scaling 

- Classic approach of deploying/installing/managing servers individually by logging in adds administrative overhead and limits ability to scale so business "loses agility"
- Chef is an [open-source configuration management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_configuration_management_software) that allows technical administrators to scale with the business by using code as infrastructure.

## Code as Infrastructure

**benefits of code**
- versioned
    - creates check points that can be restored, reused, and branched
- testable
    - test it before it's deployed
- repeatable/transferrable
    - encapsulates logic/knowledge 
    - doesn't matter who runs it
